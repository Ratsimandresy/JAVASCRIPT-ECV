    <p>
      To reiterate, I will not go through all the code for the contact page, as
      this article is focused mainly on integrating Google Map into a React
      project. Here are the steps we’re going to follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a React component to hold the map (<code>Map.jsx</code>)</li>
      <li>
        Create another React component to mark the address on the map
        (<code>LocationPin.jsx</code>)
      </li>
      <li>Embed the map component into the contact page</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><code>Map.jsx</code></h3>

    <p>
      Run the command above to create a new file in the
      <code>/components</code> folder. Inside this file, we’ll write the code
      for the map component and the address pin. Before we start writing any
      code, though, we have to install the google-map-react package by running
      the following command:
    </p>

      After installing the package, we’ll also need something else: the
      coordinates of our business address. This means a quick Google search for
      the longitude and latitude values of your business address. I’m using
      Google’s Amphitheatre address, so I did a quick search and got the
      following values:
